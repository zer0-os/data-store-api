### Build Info

## Environment Entries

Instead of a `.env` file, Azure functions use a `local.settings.json` file to define environment entries

### Local

* Install the Azure functions extension in VSCode
* `npm start` - deploys the azure functions API to localhost
* You can now hit the endpoints on localhost:7071. You can use the CPT workspace data-store postman collection to test endpoints.
